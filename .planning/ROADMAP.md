# Roadmap: Hydrophon Design-System

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a comprehensive corporate design system for Hydrophon Kunststoff GmbH across seven phases. Starting with foundational design tokens and brand identity, we build up through atomic components (icons, buttons, forms), compositional elements (navigation, cards, tables), feedback mechanisms, and comprehensive documentation, culminating in packaged deliverables for designers, developers, and marketing teams.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation & Brand Identity** - Design tokens, colors, typography, spacing, grid, and logo system
- [ ] **Phase 2: Icons & Basic Interactions** - Icon system and button components with all states
- [ ] **Phase 3: Forms & Data Input** - Complete form components with validation and accessibility
- [ ] **Phase 4: Navigation & Content Structure** - Navigation, cards, tables, and responsive layouts
- [ ] **Phase 5: Feedback & System Responses** - Modals, tooltips, and notification components
- [ ] **Phase 6: Comprehensive Documentation** - Multi-tier documentation for all user groups
- [ ] **Phase 7: Final Packaging & Delivery** - PDF compilation, asset export, and Figma library
